This project uses posts and comments from the Reddit thread https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/ since January 2014. Our dataset consists of 1,510 rows (posts) and associated information, such as the postâ€™s title, impact, user id, URL, number of comments, body text, and creation timestamp. 

This Python code conducts sentiment analysis of Reddit vaccine myth posts from  using NLTK Vader Lexicon, NRCLexicon, and ANEW word dictionary.
