So I posted in a parenting group on FB how my 18.5 week old has been quieter for the past couple of days. Nothing major I was just wondering if it's a normal part of development. 

Anyway so the majority of comments were delightful and reassuring but then I get one ""any recent vaccines""? And ""has he been vaxxed recently""? Damn I thought... Responded that yes he had a couple almost 3 weeks ago. Cue the sad reacts, angry reacts, comments ""his behaviour is definitely vaccine related"", ""you're poisoning your baby"", ""he's definitely acting weird because of the vaccines"" etc. Plus several unsolicited DMs stating how I'm poisoning and damaging my baby by vaccinating him and trying to sell me spray (I kid you not) to 'detox his skin from the metals'. Honestly I was shocked and just ignored it until people tried to do power moves ""I'm a pediatric nurse who sees this all the time in vaccinated babies"" and then I started defending myself and asking people to remain respectful and stick to the topic at hand. Tried to get some science in there (many laugh reacts in response) but I know there often futile. Honestly there were tens of people on this thread saying ""I came here to say the same thing"" etc. 

So I turn off commenting and edit to say thanks mostly to everyone but not the space for anti-vax opinion so closing comments. THEN I get a fricken message from the fricken admins saying I was being unkind by calling people OVERTLY AGAINST VACCINES anti-vaxxers and that I should either edit my post or delete it. Are you KIDDING me??? Someone literally said I was going to kill my baby and that he needs a detox (from a fricken spray bottle) and I'M being unkind?! Not to mention the thread full of misinformation and links to dodgy websites like whats in the leaflet or whatever it's called. 

Honestly I was so angry that out of all the thousands of things that could have affected my baby's behaviour some people jumped on the vaccines that he had 3 weeks ago, but that message from the admins really was the last straw - I was 'breaking the rules by being unkind' simply by defending my choice to vaccinate and asking people to remain respectful and stick to the topic. 

I'm just raging. I hate that people like this exist and I hate that there is so much distrust in the world I can't ask a simple question without it turning into some anti vax propaganda and a personal attack. I'm so worried for the future generations if kids are being brought up like this. 

That's it. Thanks for listening. Screw AVs."

**SOBRE LA VACUNA RUSA SPUTNIK V**  
The Lancet, una de las revistas m√©dicas m√°s prestigiosas del mundo, public√≥ los resultados de los ensayos de la primera y la segunda fase de la vacuna rusa SPUTNIK V, que demostraron lo siguiente:

1. La plataforma de vectores adenovirales humanos es eficaz, a pesar de las preocupaciones por la posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente a los adenovirus.

2. Se seleccion√≥ la dosis segura √≥ptima que permiti√≥ lograr una respuesta inmunitaria humoral y celular en el 100 % de los participantes, incluso en aquellos que hab√≠an tenido una infecci√≥n con adenovirus.

3. El uso de dos vectores diferentes permite lograr una respuesta inmune m√°s efectiva.

4. El nivel de anticuerpos contra el SARS-CoV-2 en voluntarios vacunados con Sputnik V fue entre 1,4 y 1,5 veces m√°s alto que el nivel de anticuerpos en los pacientes que se hab√≠an recuperado del covid-19.

5. Tiene una eficacia de 91.4 por ciento contra el virus SARS-CoV-2, y de 100 por ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de la enfermedad Covid-19.

Al mismo tiempo, no se encontraron eventos adversos graves en los vacunados con Sputnik V, mientras que para otras vacunas, este par√°metro oscila entre el 1 y el 25 por ciento.

Varias otras empresas est√°n utilizando tambi√©n plataformas basadas en vectores adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas contra el covid-19, como por ejemplo Johnson & Johnson, que usa el vector Ad26, y la china CanSino, que emplea el Ad5 mientras que la Rusa SPUTNIK V utiliza dos vectores adenovirales, el Ad5 y el Ad26.

Vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros pa√≠ses, como el vector de adenovirus de chimpanc√© (OXFORD-ASTRA ZENECA, quienes por cierto est√°n estudiando la posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su vacuna y la SPUTNIK V para incrementar su efectividad) o la tecnolog√≠a de ARN (PFIZER-BIONTECH), nunca antes hab√≠an sido utilizadas en vacunas que hayan pasado la FASE 3. Tampoco han sido sometidas a estudios a largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios en el cuerpo humano, como por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con el c√°ncer o sus efectos sobre la fertilidad.

**Las vacunas de ARN mensajero (PFIZER-BIONTECH-MODERNA).**  
La mayor preocupaci√≥n con este tipo de vacunas ha sido su inestabilidad, su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en las c√©lulas y que expresen el ant√≠geno. Tambi√©n ha preocupado el hecho de que el ARN puede estimular reacciones inmunol√≥gicas de tipo inflamatorio, por lo que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo. El ARN es una mol√©cula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas (de menos 80‚ÑÉ), se degrada muy f√°cilmente por enzimas y no se internaliza de forma eficiente.

Sin embargo, esta tecnolog√≠a tambi√©n tiene ventajas. Es relativamente m√°s barata que otro tipo de vacunas y, sobre todo, permite dise√±ar una vacuna nueva en un tiempo r√©cord. Una vez que se conoce el genoma del pat√≥geno, en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales, lo que la convierte en una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un pat√≥geno nuevo para el que se necesita una vacuna con urgencia, como en una pandemia. En este caso, la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad. Moderna fue capaz de dise√±ar su vacuna de ARNm contra SARS-CoV-2 tan solo seis semanas despu√©s de que el genoma del virus se hiciera p√∫blico.

**MI OPINI√ìN.**  
Por un lado la vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de vacunas ya probados, innova en el sentido de usar dos vectores en lugar de uno solo. Es un modelo que, si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en las vacunas de ARN mensajero, es m√°s segura en t√©rminos de efectos secundarios adversos e igual de efectiva que la vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora y que nos hemos aplicado.

Por el otro lado Pfizer y otras le apuestan al futuro y a lo econ√≥mico, puede que en esta ocasi√≥n tengan tropezones pero el avance que van a lograr es un ahorro en a√±os de investigaci√≥n, a√∫n as√≠, como el resto de las vacunas, el reto ser√° que en el mediano y largo plazo resulten eficaces y que sus efectos adversos sean m√≠nimos para poder compararlas con el modelo tradicional de vacunas que, guste o no a pol√≠ticos y villamelones, es eficaz y seguro.

**¬øCONCLUSI√ìN?**  
Me encuentro optimista, las vacunas contra el COVID19 comentadas en este texto han demostrado cient√≠ficamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver y prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias. La competencia entre cient√≠ficos es sana y provoca desarrollos alternativos, lo que nos permite tener varias respuestas a un mismo problema y con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que, de acuerdo a cada pa√≠s, pueden ser m√°s adecuadas para cada uno.   

¬øGuerra fr√≠a en pleno siglo XXI?

This post contains facts that will help you win any vaccine debate.","This comprehensive and thorough list of facts will help you to counter and win any vaccine debate. If an antivaxer is attacking you or making baseless/outlandish + unscientific claims, you can use this list of information to shut their arguments down immediately with facts:

\-**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.

\-Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported. It is estimated by a Harvard study using data mining technology + VAERS reports that **adverse events are reported at 100x** (or more) the **rate that they actually occur.**

\-One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects** (like the placebo effect, people believe/imagine they are having symptoms due to fear/expectation)

\-Not **a single case of autism** has ever made it to higher courts, because the **autism + vaccine connection has an overwhelming amount of research debunking it.**

\-in 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability** for their product to reassure the public of safety: this is because research has proven without doubt that vaccines are **incredibly safe.** Despite manufacture liability, vaccine manufactures have never actually needed to pay out any amount for any purported ""injury"" claims. The evidence is overwhelming to **debunk these claims.**

\-**Andrew Wakefield,** a public disgrace and conspiracist theorist with multiple agendas, is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**. His paper was later **retracted for fraud** and his licence **revoked**.

\-**Vaccine inserts** list events that occur normally in populations and **do NOT prove any causative association** between vaccines and these purported ""events"". If the events listed in vaccine inserts actually \*caused\* these effects, billions in personal injury lawsuits would be paid out --> which is *not* the case!

\-Unlike what antivaxers claim, it has been proven thoroughly that Gardasil is incredibly safe. The supposed ""injuries"" that circulate the internet in the form of horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of mass psychogenic events, instigated by fear + the nocebo effect.

\-The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals, even at doses higher than used in humans.

\-The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and thoroughly investigated for safety, and no issues have been found.

\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no issues have been found.

\-Despite some ethical concerns raised, several vaccinated vs. unvaccinated studies have been conducted. It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.

\-Vaccines are thought to have a potential neuroprotective and anti-cancer effect, which is still being studied. It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer, although further investigation is needed.

\-All clinical trials for vaccines use double-blinded trials with saline placebos, which is the gold standard in medical research.

\-The FDA has an independent taxpayer-funded committee to examine and analyze all raw data from vaccine clinical trials. Scientists and data analysts conducting this research have extensive background testing to ensure no conflicts of interest in any pharmaceutical company. This debunks the myth of ""conflict of interest"" regarding vaccine manufacturers funding their own safety studies for FDA/CDC approval.

\-There are comprehensive laws to prevent the myth of the ‚Äúrevolving door‚Äù phenomenon that anti-vaxers like to use as proof of government-pharmaceutical corruption. If a scientist/researcher who investigated vaccine safety has had any financial ties to a pharmaceutical company, they are disqualified from the vaccine approval committee. Similarly, once an individual has worked in the field of vaccine approval for the FDA/CDC, they are unable to accept positions as pharmaceutical-hired scientists. These laws prevent conflicts of interest between vaccine approval and pharmaceutical profit.

\-Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.

\-The USA has very high vaccination rates as well as one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in all developed nations.

\-France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed countries of similar socioeconomic structure.

\-Autism is ‚Äúmore prevalent‚Äù due to more advanced and specific diagnostic criteria. Once diagnostic criteria was established, people of older generations (age 50‚Äôs-80‚Äôs) were found to have nearly identical rates of autism to those of younger generations (age 40‚Äôs and under).

There are a lot of incentives to jump through hoops with any vaccine that ""works"" well enough in studies and is feasible to produce.
Also, there are many many laboratories, universities and pharma companies that want in on this.
The fight to be ""first"" will be more important then waiting for the safest and most efficient vaccine (guess where the money is).

This also includes political willingness to say ""this is good enough, spread it"". 

So proper vaccine scientists warn that the temptation to approve **any** vaccine will probably be an issue.
Also, there are many new technologies being used for this vaccine, some of them never before used for vaccine development in humans.
There are a lot of unknowns, so experts are saying ""let the science be done, don't rush it""

5,5.56284963457791,4.844074466763908,slightly contented,Comment,"1.) The movie they cited as their source, ‚ÄúVaxxed‚Äù, was written by Andrew Wakefield. He is a former UK doctor who was hired by a group of parents to find a link between vaccines and autism. He published a study finding the link in the highly respected medical journal the ‚ÄúLancet‚Äù. It was later found that he falsified the results of his study, and also performed very unethical and invasive tests on children with autism to ‚Äúprove‚Äù his findings (think unnecessary spinal taps and other painful procedures). His was the first, and I believe only, article to be retracted in the Lancet in all its years of publication. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and ability to continue practicing medicine in the UK. No doctors, in any country, have ever completed a study that replicated his results. An important factor of scientific studies is they need to be repeatable. If nobody else is getting the same results, his study is suspect regardless of the ethics of it (but that‚Äôs a huge deal anyways) I would be HIGHLY skeptical of anything that has his name on it.

2.) The movie Vaxxed is only showing one ‚Äúside‚Äù of the story, if you can call it that. It‚Äôs meant to scare people and to convince them that vaccines are bad. It isn‚Äôt a sound source because it‚Äôs heavily biased and does not present all the information, only the information that supports their narrative.

3.) Vaccine injuries are a real thing. However, they are also incredibly rare. I am not a doctor, or medical professional in any capacity, so I don‚Äôt have hard science for you. But look at the number of people who have been fully vaccinated and compare that to the number of people who have vaccine caused injuries. My entire life, 99% of the people I know are fully vaccinated, and not a single one of them had any impairment attributed to vaccines. I‚Äôd do some research into the actual chances of vaccine injury. But I‚Äôm almost positive that the chances of a vaccine injury are significantly smaller than the chances of injury from other routine or necessary/life saving procedures that we don‚Äôt bat an eye at (think surgeries and the like)

4.) The hole in the logic of anti-Vaxxers that I‚Äôve never heard them answer is this: if you break an arm, where are you going to go? Answer: the doctor‚Äôs. They wouldn‚Äôt think twice about it. I know anti-vaxxers who have rushed their children to the doctor for a high fever. However, they also claim big pharma is a conspiracy and trying to hurt you. If the vaccines aren‚Äôt safe, how can anything the doctor says/does be trusted? Either they are in on the conspiracy or they are dumb enough to be taken in by it, and either way how can you trust them? Also, the FDA approves the vaccines, and they also approve the other meds you might take/a doctor might prescribe you. How can you trust ANY of that if the vaccines are a huge conspiracy? You‚Äôre better off staying away entirely if that‚Äôs the case.

5.) The ingredients in vaccines sound scary, sure. I wouldn‚Äôt trust myself to mix a vaccine safely. However, I am not a doctor. I didn‚Äôt spend years studying medicine, and then following strict procedures and countless peer-reviewed and tested studies to have the know-how to make vaccines. Just like I wouldn‚Äôt trust myself to wire a house, because I have no experience, but I would trust an electrician. Or how I would trust a cardiologist to perform open heart surgery on me but I wouldn‚Äôt trust my husband because he isn‚Äôt a medical professional.

6.) On their whole ‚Äúingestion vs injection‚Äù thing; broccoli is totally safe to ingest. We recommend people ingestion broccoli as it‚Äôs very good for you. We do not recommend people injecting broccoli into their bloodstream. Again, I‚Äôm not a doctor, but injecting broccoli into your body will kill you. Should we get rid of broccoli?

7.) Vaccines seem unnecessary, but it‚Äôs because they work. Vaccines stop the spread of dangerous and even deadly diseases. When enough people vaccinate, it protects the vulnerable populations (elderly, very young, immunocompromised, and those who for one reason or another cannot receive vaccines). The disease cannot spread, causing it to effectively die out, or at least prevents it from becoming a pandemic. This whole Coronavirus thing is actually a good illustration of how bad a pandemic can be and how beneficial these vaccines are. Smallpox, measles, heck even the flu, all used to tear through communities and kill/injure a lot of people. Modern medicine helps, but the vaccines keep it from spreading like wildfire in the first place. When was the last measles epidemic? Or the last smallpox outbreak? We vaccinate for those, and while a case of measles or two might pop up every now and then, we aren‚Äôt shutting down cities because of an outbreak.

I hope this helps! Sorry for the novel, this is everything I‚Äôve been wanting to say to my anti-Vaxxer friends and haven‚Äôt really been able to, so typing this up was kind of cathartic."

Different vaccine, different indications and schedules. Obviously insurance system will affect antenatal care and screenings, which affect the risk/benefit analysis for something like the Hep B vaccine (which, again, is not the same as the vaccine you're mentioning in the UK). It's just a different healthcare system. That there are different immunization schedules isn't particularly surprising or even necessarily meaningful.

>Aren't babies particularly sensitive when they are first borne?

The vaccine is tolerated fine, so I dunno what else this would imply that's worth addressing.

>I was thinking that it makes more sense not to give unneeded vaccines or medications on the first day of life just to improve compliance

It's not ""unneeded"" on day 1 any more than day 60 or day 600. You derive more benefit from earlier vaccination by definition. It also improves compliance because you already have started the schedule, informed the parents, and can test the mother. 

>although if there are testing errors I can understand this

That and screening insufficiencies, etc. 

>Why are you always so hostile?

Why are you always quick to make sweeping and uninformed judgments? I've just got no patience for such nonsense, and if you have any intellectual honesty then you'll grit your teeth, take the lumps where you've earned them, and be better for it.

To belabor the point that this is a pretty vapid comment:

>>Universal HepB vaccination of all infants beginning at birth provides a critical safeguard and prevents infection among infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers not identified prenatally (e.g., in situations where the mother was not tested or when testing, interpretation, or transcription errors occurred).

>>Approximately 88% of commercially insured women and 84% of Medicaid-enrolled women are tested for HBsAg during pregnancy (27). In one study of a large health system in northern California, 93% of HBsAg-positive pregnant women were tested for HBV DNA (28). Most (94.9%) infants born to infected women receive recommended prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth (29). 

>>Universal HepB vaccine birth dose coverage, defined as 1 dose of vaccine administered by 3 days of life, is 71.1% (30), an increase from 50.1% during 2003‚Äì2005 prior to revised ACIP recommendations for the birth dose before hospital discharge (31), but below the Healthy People 2020 target of 85% (32).

So we have [three good reasons](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm). First, through failure to identify Hep B positive mothers through two different mechanisms, and for compliance reasons (the baby *is* right there, after all).

Now the UK does it differently. They have both a different healthcare/insurance system, and they also use a hexavalent vaccine rather than monovalent Hep B vaccines. That's two levels of incongruent comparisons, and no particular substantive reason to delay other than if you support lower compliance rates and increased testing failure risks.

But, hey, glad you see no issue with it."

Probably because chickenpox is more serious for adults than children, and is a virus that can build up long term immunity, so she is hoping that by getting chickenpox now will prevent a more serious case of chickenpox when the kids are older

>Is it not dangerous?

Serious complications are not common, 1 in 300-500 chickenpox cases requires hospitalization and 1 in 60,000 results in death [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications)

>My kids are both fully vaccinated (4 and 2 years old), are they protected?

No guarantee, the vaccine is not 100% effective, and the second dose isn't given until age 4-6, so it is still best to keep your kids away from sick people until they are no longer sick. According to the CDC a person with chickenpox is no longer contagious 24 hours after that last new spot appears, which shouldn't be more than a week or so after the start of symptoms

>Arent your risk of getting shingles greatly increased if you have had the chicken pox?

Yes, it is pretty much impossible to get shingles if you haven't had chickenpox or a chickenpox vaccine

>I am pregnant but had them as a kid, am i protected?

This is probably a question for your doctor, but there is no guarantee, and live vaccines such as chickenpox aren't recommended for pregnant women, so avoid exposure to infected people especially while pregnant, as harm to the fetus is possible [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications)

Yes, (well you can still get a little sick) but antivaxers are concerned about combinations of viruses in one vaccine, multiple vaccines at the same them, and chemical additives (although most of the chemical additives of concern are only used for vaccines against things that you can't build up immunity to from catching them)"

Example for the rotavirus vaccine

>A key ethical aspect considered when adopting the placebo-controlled design was that the risks of withholding rotavirus vaccine could be (and were) mitigated by rehydration counselling and regular check-ups. 


Another problem with that is that these vaccines were proven over and over again that they are effective. And there are multiple methods to do that without risking someone's lives. Like testing for antibodies. It's simple, it's effective, it doesn't cost that much, especially not a life!

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157320/

>Against this backdrop, the WHO Department of Ethics and Social Determinants convened an expert consultation to provide recommendations on the use of placebo controls in vaccine trials in cases where an efficacious vaccine already exists. 

See? It's not like the dropped the vaccines on the market and then let them do damage and hope for the best. The vaccines were extensively tested anyway, so yeah, now maybe they can have some placebo tests done, if it doesn't risk... let's say, an infant's life. But they don't even need to do that. They just have to use an unvaccinated cohort (and they can find that for sure, either because of poverty, lack of vaccines, etc) and compare the results.

>While this paper focuses specifically on the use of placebo controls, similar considerations apply to open designs in which a placebo is not used, but an unvaccinated control group is included.

For the other thing: https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/aluminum-and-vaccines-its-time-to-clear-up-the-pseudoscience/

First it was ""mercury"" or thimerosal, which is a salt of mercury. Now it's aluminium. They're just moving goal posts. 

The dose makes the poison. From a 0,5 ml dose of a vaccine, aluminium will not be in such a high quantity and it will be eliminated from the body within 72 h and wouldn't be able to travel anywhere, since it's injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. 

In fact, it stays there, irritates the skin, draws white blood cells to it and then will help create a higher immune response than a vaccine without it. That's it. 


Doesn't cross the brain's barrier, doesn't accumulate, doesn't do... whatever they claim today.

Since your post asks about Mercury, I'll explain that a little more. Elemental mercury isn't the same as organic mercury. If your only chemistry background was in high school or not even then, it's understandable that you may not fully understand this. 

Methanol, HOCH3, is extremely poisonous to humans on low doses. Ethanol, HO(CH3)2, so off by just a saturated carbon, is drinking alcohol. Not safe, but not poisonous at moderate doses. That's just a couple atoms. 

A better example might even be oxygen. Breathing in the oxygen you do, diatomic oxygen, O2, is MUCH different than elemental or ionic oxygen. One let's you live, the other rips apart DNA. That's just a couple electrons. 

The best example, as always, is table salt. Sodium in it's elemental,uncharged, +0 state explodes in reaction with water. Chlorine in it's elemental, uncharged form is an incredibly poisonous gas. But guess what? When these are combined, or for specificty's sake, one electron is removed from each, they become a flavorful, harmless salt. That's one electron that separates an explosive sodium with a dissolvable sodium ion. 

In that same spirit, the mercury that used to be in vaccines wasn't in elemental form. It was in this compound.
 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Thiomersal.svg/1200px-Thiomersal.svg.png

That looks pretty complex, right? The way molecules are structured doesn't allow for atoms to ""be themselves"" when in a compound. Mercury here (in it's +2 state) can't do what we all know elemental mercury, or even worse, methylmercury, can do. It can't just break free and be a dangerous atom. The resonance forms from the ring as well as the heavy metal salt component make it a completely unique compound; not just the sum of its parts. It's much more complex than that. 

If that's too confusing, I'm sorry. That's the way it is. Hope it helps"

11,5.305135534272585,5.0060855231385295,slightly happy,This is how vaccines were linked to autism,"It stemmed from an article published by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues back in the 1998 in the UK.

In the study, Wakefield looked at 12 children with gastrointestinal issues also had neurological deficits. Eight of those children received the MMR vaccine. He concluded the article saying they couldn't prove a connection between the MMR vaccine and the gastrointestinal issues because the evidence is inadequate. Nowhere in the article he said there was a link between autism and the vaccine, until Wakefield claimed that it did in a press conferences.

His article was published in *the Lancet*, a well-known medicinal journal, and he was known to be a prestigious and highly regarded doctor( he's the doctor who identify the cause of Crohn's disease), so when the public heard of the vaccine-autism link, the public ate it up, fear arose, and vaccination rates dropped.

The article and his claims are farfetch once you look at the detail. First, the size of his studies was too small, only 12 children, making any connection seem statistically significant. There was only a few variables were studies and according to him, those 12 children exhibited forms of autism (the symptoms were not akin to autism). Not only that, his study didn't have the Ethical Practice Committee approve the study, which is necessary to ensure that the research doesn't harm its participants.

What's worse it that it was discovered after much denial that Wakefield was being funded $800,000 by a personal injury lawyer named Richard Barr, who needed evidence that autism was caused by vaccine for cases of parents of autistic children who were suing pharmaceutical companies for compensation. Five of the 12 children were even clients of Barr. Wakefield's collaborators didn't even know about the money and were furious enough to retract their names for the study. But Wakefield had another motive. He advocated that vaccines need to be safe and tells the public that the current MMR vaccine isn't safe. Prior to his study, he was applying for a vaccine patent, he wanted to make his own MMR vaccine and wanted to get rid of the completion.

Wakefield had his medical license evoked in 2005. This should have been the end of the myth, but sadly no. He moved to the USA and is still highly regarded by people. Now his MMR and autism phase is dying down, but his new topic takes the spotlight, mercury in vaccines."

But without those preservatives, vaccines will have a very short shelf life and then afterward inefficient.  Parents may question if that's enough reason to expose their children to poison. I wanted to reassure and inform that those ingredients are harmless, despite its name and known uses, because of its dosage.

Anything in the world can act as a poison or be completely harmless depending on the dosage. So just because something sounds good or bad doesn't mean that any dosage of it remains so. For example, too much vitamin A can actually poison you and damage your liver.

Here is a list of some ingredients in vaccines and their dosage, as well as some usages:

* Aluminum hydroxide: Used as a adjuvant (helps with efficacy of vaccine) in the DTap (0.625 mg). Also used antacids and in infant formula (0.225 mg per liter).
* Formaldehyde: Prevent growth of harmful bacteria in vaccine. All vaccine combined has 1.2 mg of it, while 1 kg of bananas has 16.3 mg.
* Monosodium Glutamate: Help preserve vaccines and used as a flavor enhancer. Some flu vaccines contain 0.188 mg of MSG, while grape juice can contain 0.258 mg per 100 grams.
* Sodium Chloride: Another name for salt and some vaccine have them to keep them in a state that will not badly affect the cells.
* Sorbitol: Preservative, found naturally in fruits, and also used a sweetener in sugar-free products. MMR vaccine has 15 mg and 1 stick of sugar-free gum has 1.25 g."

Congratulations! We have [data](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/addm-community-report/differences-in-children.html) on that. It doesn't support your hypothesis--that non-white ethnicities have higher ASD diagnosis. So we keep piling up the implausibility. You have to now plausibly explain why higher antibody titers or other unknown immune response factors to a vaccine lead to differential ASD diagnosis among races. And *then* you have to explain why in *your* link there is no difference among genders--which is a hallmark for differential ASD diagnosis. Oops, guess ya didn't read that after all.

So, yes, I'm curious: how would race, but not gender, impact ASD development according to the above link when this 1) doesn't fit epi data on ASD diagnosis among ethnicities; 2) doesn't fit gender epi data on ASD diagnosis? But we know the answer: you haven't thought about it and you don't care. You just bring up some random hair-brained idea to deal with your cognitive dissonance.

>I'm ""caucasian"". I've also found out I have fairly recent genetic ties to subsaharan Africa.

>That was a pretty big fuckup too, wasn't it? One in five europeans carrying a dormant gene for narcolepsy that the vaccine adjuvant just happened to trigger?

Uh oh, sounds like you don't know much about AS03, MF59, or the Pandemrix situation and that this is just a random distraction from the actual conversation you've so thoroughly lost. No worries--I'm used to having to fill you in on everything.

The Pandemrix association with narcolepsy appears to be a cryptic antigen site, not related to any of the adjuvants used in the pandemic vaccines. Read the [multi-country](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6404226/) assessment which looked at several AS03 and one MF59 vaccine, as well as the safety assessment of [AS03](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19305225?via%3Dihub). 

Also, you don't seem to understand how genes work. The vaccine didn't trigger a ""dormant gene"".

It's actually closer to 0% in areas where it's been eliminated, due to vaccination.

There's also a whole host of terrible sequalae associated with the virus. And the known fact that anyone framing a situation as ""the only thing you should care about is the rate at which you will literally die"" is a complete asshat.

It's actually closer to 1 in 10,000 or 0.01% of cases. 

To put it in perspective, 1 in 10,000 is the same probability of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime. (Howstuffworks.com) 

Proof: https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/critical-calculation-error-in-background-information-for-hearing-on-vaccines-save-lives-what-is-driving-preventable-disease-outbreaks-on-march-5-2019/

Prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, ‚Äúthere were an estimated 3 to 4 million people infected with measles in the United States, and as many as 500 related deaths each year,‚Äù which is correct. However, this computes to a number of deaths which, at most, is one in 6,000 (3,000,000 divided by 500). More precisely, between 1959 and 1962, about 400 measles deaths occurred among about 4,000,000 measles cases, which results in a one in 10,000 (0.01%) chance of a child dying from measles, not one in 500 or one in 1,000. By comparison, over 23,000 infant deaths occur every year in the U.S. and thus the chance of a child dying in his or her first year of life is currently one in 170 (0.6%)‚Äîthis is 60 times the risk of a child dying from measles in 1962, a time period when almost every child had measles by age 15.

The reason this calculation error unfortunately commonly occurs is because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes case-fatality rates based on the number of¬†reported¬†cases only. And, since it is estimated that nearly 90% of measles cases are benign and therefore¬†not reported¬†to the CDC, the widely publicized measles case-fatality rate is a 10-fold miscalculation. Such an error has grave public health consequences.

Lastly, vaccinations contain very weak forms of the virus the vaccination protects you against. Your body produces white blood cells to fight against these forms and produces the right antibodies for it. So if it ever got back into your body, you have the antibodies ready.

If everything she claims in this post is true, then vaccines are the devil. I know that's not the case, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to refute most of her points, so I was wondering if any of you were.

Here's the post:

""Contrary to the view that non-vaccinators are uneducated fools duped by conspiracy theories, most have taken the time to study the scientific data that show most vaccinations not to be worth the risk. Even the Supreme Court has deemed vaccination to be ""unavoidably unsafe"".
Are you aware that, by law, the CDC sponsors a vaccine injury database called VAERS -- the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. According to VAERS data, over the past 10 years alone, 26,793 people have been hospitalized with vaccine injuries and 2,081 have died. Did you know that 162 young people, mostly healthy teenage girls, have now died after receiving the HPV vaccine?
Did you know that, in exchange for granting legal immunity to vaccine manufacturers, the US government sponsors a vaccine court that awards compensation to families with vaccine-injured children? This court has paid out billions of dollars to families, including for children whose autism was deemed to have been caused by vaccination. Did you know that a 2005 FDA report on the Tripedia DTP vaccine listed many neurological problems as potential side effects, including autism?
Did you know that one of the key studies that supposedly exonerated vaccines from causing autism was authored by Poul Thorsen, now a fugitive wanted for money laundering and fraud? And that, in contrast to what is constantly repeated in the media, there are dozens of studies implicating vaccines as playing a role in causing autism, as well as many other neurological and chronic diseases, including Type 1 diabetes (also on the rise in children)? Did you know that a 2011 study in Germany that compared vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations found unvaccinated children to be far more healthy, with much lower rates of asthma, allergies, ear infections, epilepsy, gluten sensitivities, GERD, anxiety and depression, autism, and dyslexia?
Did you know that a growing number of physicians and immunologists are admitting that vaccination may not be worth the risk? They point out that, in an effort to avoid the childhood diseases (which only 60 years ago were considered beneficial because they triggered true immunity and spurts in child development), we may be causing an increase in chronic disease and a form of disease immunity that is not as strong and longlasting? Did you know that recent outbreaks of childhood diseases among vaccinated children is not due to their ""contamination"" by unvaccinated children or due to loss of so-called ""herd immunity"", but rather, is usually occurring in completely vaccinated populations because their artificial immunity is waning?
Please understand. Parents who wish to forego vaccination for their children are not asking that others follow their lead. They simply want to be permitted to follow their beliefs and not be forced to administer these drugs to their children. Indeed, many of these families already have a vaccine-injured child. Each year, the extremely powerful vaccine industry sponsors media campaigns (like the one we are currently experiencing) whose ultimately goal is to force everyone to become their customers. As a society, we must preserve our human right not to be forceably injected and medicated against our will."""
